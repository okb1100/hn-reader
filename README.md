# Yet Another Hacker News Reader

I created this project because I am using [Limit Extension]([Limit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/limit-set-limits-for-dist/blcdfhbibkkjpfdddnmnmhfgjlicebba?hl=en)) to limit how much time I spend reading on HN but it does not count the external links. 

It shows a basic iframe preview of the posted link so I don't leave the current page while reading...

## TODO

[x] Fetch HN Posts

[x] Sort types (top, new, best)

[ ] Fix broken post urls or find a workaround

[ ] Pagination

[ ] Nice UI

[ ] "Open link on new tab" button

[ ] Show comments section

[ ] Show post metadata


## Maybe

[ ] Read later

[ ] Live updates
